- create a release build -

* make new dir, cd to this dir

cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <path_to_src>

- set the compiler -
cmake uses the CC/CXX envvars, and they stick to the build dir. regardless, it's a good idea to have these set correctly for your current build

export CC=/path/to/somewhere/clang
export CXX=/path/to/somewhere/clang++
cmake -GNinja <path_to_src>
